# report.ai: AI-Powered Hate Crime Reporting Tool

## Overview
Report.ai tackles the widespread issue of underreporting and ineffective handling of hate crimes on college campuses. Using an advanced AI model, it streamlines the reporting process to generate clear, reliable, and effective email reports. Originally developed by four junior students at Lehigh University during the Hack for Justice hackathon, Report.ai aims to transform how hate crimes are reported and addressed in academic settings.

## Problem
- Underreporting: A significant number of hate crimes go unreported, with studies suggesting that approximately 50% of violent and non-violent hate crimes are not reported to police
- Limited awareness: Students and faculty often lack knowledge about what constitutes a hate crime and how to report it, further contributing to underreporting
- Inadequate response: When hate crimes are reported, the response from institutions is sometimes insufficient or inconsistent, discouraging future reporting

## Solution
- Providing an AI-powered platform that makes reporting hate crimes more accessible and less intimidating for students and faculty.
- Streamlining the reporting process, ensuring that all necessary information is collected efficiently and accurately.
- Increasing awareness about hate crimes through educational components integrated into the platform.
- Facilitating a more consistent and effective response to reported incidents by providing institutions with comprehensive, well-organized, documented data.
